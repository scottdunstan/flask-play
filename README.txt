This project is the code committed when following the Flasky project
in the book "Flask Web Development Developing Web Applications With Python"
By the Author Miguel Grinberg.

For the most part, it will follow Miguel's steps, but I will occassionally
play around, so the code won't be exactly the same.

I will try to comment in the code where the concept is difficult, or
where my code is drastically devorced from the book's.
